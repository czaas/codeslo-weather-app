# My weather app

Based off the instructions on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/show-the-local-weather" target="_blank">free code camp</a>

## How it works

1. Reaches out to <a href="http://ip-api.com/"  target="_blank">ip-api.com</a> and gets an inital zip code based on your IP address
2. Then it reaches out to <a href="http://openweathermap.org/api" target="_blank">open weather map api</a>
3. Then it updates the UI based on multiple app variables as seen in the `APP_STATE` object

## To do
- look into better weather icons: https://github.com/erikflowers/weather-icons
- ~~style the app~~
